            A Reader-Response Approach on "You've Reached Sam"</h1>
        <h2 class="title-sub">Written by Jan Yzack Trinidad - Dec. 16, 2024</h2>
    </section>
    <section class="body-section">
        <p>You've Reached Sam by Dustin Thao tells the story of Julie, a girl grieving the sudden death of her boyfriend Sam. Thanks to a magical phone connection, she has the chance to listen to his voice once more, connecting life and death. This story made me feel a lot of emotions, and here’s what I thought about it as a reader. 

            </p>
            <p> As a Grade 12 student, I was able to relate to Julie’s grief and longing because it reflects the fear of losing a loved one. Although I haven't gone through that situation, it's something that has me thinking about what that would be like because of the author's vivid details of Julie's feelings. The book made me think about how I value the people around me and how fragile those relationships can be.


            </p>
            <p> 
                Because the phone calls between Julie and Sam were bittersweet it made sense. They offered closure, but not without making Julie think of what she lost. I kept asking myself: Would I cling to such a connection, or would I let go and move forward? I can totally get Julie’s not deleting Sam’s voicemails and memories. It must be tough to let go, but even tougher to keep hold of something that causes you pain. 

            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to this, the story’s setting with Julie’s friends and family made me realize how much I rely on my own family. It made me realize that no matter what happens or how sad you are, life moves on, and people around us can provide unexpected sources of strength.

            </p>
            <p>
                A scene that got to me was when Julie chooses to bid Sam farewell. As I am reading it feels like I was there almost saying goodbye to a part of myself—the part that does not want to let go of my past.  This helped me understand that we all have emotional baggage regardless of age and we must face it even though it may be painful.

            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, You've Reached Sam taught me how love and happy memories that stay alive in our hearts can help us heal from grief. I appreciated how the book allowed me to feel the characters’ emotions and reflect on my own experiences. It reminded me to cherish the present and the people I love while I still can.
