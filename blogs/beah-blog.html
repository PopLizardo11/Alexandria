            A Reader-Centered Approach on Akutagawa's "In a Bamboo Grove"</h1>
        <h2 class="title-sub">Written by Beah Eunice Olan - Dec. 16, 2024</h2>
    </section>
    <section class="body-section">
        <p> “In a Bamboo Grove” is a pursuit of truth, a revelation of insight into human nature. Written by
            Ryunosuke Akutagawa, a highly influential Japanese author renowned for his works of
            psychological depth, the story examines the mystery of who killed Kanazawa no Takehiko
            through a unique narrative structure composed entirely of testimonies from four witnesses and
            confessions from three suspects. Akutagawa skillfully amplifies the differences between the
            narrators to highlight their unreliability. In doing so, he draws readers closer to the author’s true
            thoughts and philosophy. This narrative technique exposes the profound skepticism at the heart
            of In a Bamboo Grove, where the search for meaning lies not in the “facts” of the story, but in
            the fragile, contradictory humanity of those who recount it.
            </p>
            <p> The story functions as a riddle without a definitive answer, as the mystery of who murdered
                Kanazawa no Takehiko remains unsolved. However, the central focus of In a Bamboo Grove is
                not the identity of the murderer, but rather the nature of truth itself. This shift from solving a
                crime to questioning truth aligns the narrative with existentialist thought, emphasizing the
                ambiguity and subjectivity inherent in human perception.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Upon reading the story, it appears to be a complicated text and is difficult to understand. At
                first, my reading motivation is to discern the murderer, but as I continued reading, it became
                clear that solving the mystery wasn’t the story’s true aim. Instead, Akutagawa encouraged me to
                reflect on the nature of truth and how subjective it can be. I was particularly struck by how
                unreliable each narrator was. Tajomaru, Masago, and even the spirit of Takehiko himself all had
                motives to distort the story, making me question everything they said. Even the supporting
                characters, like the wood cutter, revealed biases that made their accounts suspicious. These
                contradictions forced me to confront the reality that even “objective” witnesses are shaped by
                their own perspectives and flaws.
            </p>
            <p>
                What stayed with me, however, was how the story left me with no clue or answers. The story
                reminded me of existentialist ideas, the notion that we live in a world where truth is fragmented
                and shaped by perception. Rather than focusing on the crime, I was thinking about how much
                each narrators’ stories reflected their bias, decision making and perspective. In the end, the
                story felt less like a mystery and more like a mirror, showing me how truth often mirrors our own
                fractured realities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ehrlinger et al. (2015) note that people rely on cognitive schemas or mental shortcuts to
                make daily decisions quickly and efficiently, often without conscious awareness. These
                shortcuts help individuals arrive at judgments that are usually adequate and accurate. Similarly,
                in In a Bamboo Grove, the characters’ accounts of the murder reveal how their decisions and
                perceptions are shaped by personal biases and self-serving motives. Each narrator interprets
                and recounts the events in a way that aligns with their own interests or desires, demonstrating
                how cognitive biases distort their judgment. For example, Tajomaru, the bandit, presents himself
                as a brave and noble fighter, likely influenced by his desire to maintain a heroic image, despite
                his criminal actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In The Psychology of Literature (2002), literature enables readers to project their own
                emotions and biases onto narratives, prompting them to engage with the complex, subjective
                nature of truth. This aligns with In a Bamboo Grove, where the unreliable narrators’
                contradictory accounts challenge readers to reflect on the fluidity of truth and the role personal
                biases play in shaping perception. Oatley further suggests that narratives serve as “mirrors” to
                human emotions and cognition, reflecting the complexities of individual thought. In this way,
                Akutagawa’s story encourages readers to recognize how their own understanding of truth may
                be similarly fractured and subjective
            <p>
                As a result, this mysterious yet deeply disturbing story “In a Bamboo Grove” challenges us to
                engage with the depth truth and human nature. Using a unique narrative structure based on
                testimony that is inconsistent and unreliable.l As characters' biases, motives, and personal
                desires influence their memories, readers are reminded that truth is not a fixed entity, but rather
                a deception shaped by individual experiences and cognitive biases. In the end, “In a Bamboo
                Grove” overcomes the mystery. It becomes a mirror that reflects the very complex and
                subjective way people often deal with the truth and meaning of their own lives.
