    </section>
    <section class="body-section">
        <p> Frankenstein, the novel by Mary Shelley, is an insightful review of the economic, social, 
            and intellectual forces that dominated the Industrial Revolution. The novel examines the 
            damaging effects of class strife, alienation, and exploitation through the prism of Marxist
             ideology. Marxist criticism, according to Cole and Oglesby (2023), links social and political 
             problems to disputes between members of various socioeconomic groups. Shelley emphasizes the 
             dehumanizing consequences of industrialization and the bourgeoisie's contempt for the
              working class by focusing on Victor Frankenstein's encounter with the beast. Originating 
              from the aspirations of the scientific bourgeoisie, the creature represents the downtrodden 
              proletariat, which is alienated, exploited, and consequently driven to rebellion.

            </p>
            <p> The bourgeois class, represented by Victor Frankenstein, uses ambition, power, and the 
                desire for self-interest to establish control over social systems (Ryan, 2024). His 
                scientific pursuits, like those discussed in Chapter 4, are a reflection of capitalism's
                 ambition to control nature and exploit resources. According to Marxist theory, Victor is 
                 a capitalist who employs scientific instruments and experiments to create something new 
                 while ignoring or avoiding accountability for the results of his labor.

            </p>
            <p> 
                Furthermore, Victor’s obsession with managing life and death, particularly obvious in Chapter 5 
                as he animates the creature, metaphorically represents the capitalist pursuit of unrestrained
                 production without concern for ethical or social consequences. Victor prioritizes the process 
                 of creation over the well-being of the final product, much like an industrial-era factory owner
                  would. In the same way as capitalists frequently ignore the laborers who produce their wealth,
                   he recoils in disgust after finishing his work and leaves the creature behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Victor's scientific aspirations gave rise to the creature, which represents the oppressed underclass,
                 or proletariat (Butler, 2024). Both Victor and society at large reject the creature, which is first 
                 characterized in Chapters 10–12 as innocent and yearning for company. This rejection reflects the 
                 alienation that the working class experiences when they are dismissed as nothing more than industrial 
                 equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The creature's increasing awareness of human culture highlights its estrangement in Chapter 15, 
                when it comes across Paradise Lost, Plutarch's Lives, and The Sorrows of Werter. Its awareness of
                 its marginalized status is heightened by these books, which intensifies its animosity for Victor.
                  Chapters 16–20 describe the creature's growing resentment and ultimately actions of retaliation,
                   which can be seen as the proletariat's inevitable revolt against the bourgeoisie as a result of
                    years of institutionalized tyranny.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alienation is a major Marxist motif in Frankenstein, and it shows up for both Victor and the monster.
                 Marx's theory of alienation holds that under capitalism, workers become separated from their labor, 
                 the goods they produce, and themselves (Leopold, 2022). As demonstrated in Chapters 3-5, Victor feels
                  alienated from his loved ones as a result of his compulsive quest for knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                The alienation is even deeper for the creature. Similar to the proletariat's alienation from the 
                fruits of their labor, the creature describes its early experiences of desertion. It is denied the 
                company it longs for, shunned by the human race, and viewed as a monster due to its appearance. The 
                creature's request for a mate, an equal to share its misery, is denied by Victor in Chapter 16,
                 signifying the capitalist's reluctance to provide the downtrodden with solidarity or collective 
                 action, further solidifies this alienation (Erol, n.d.).

            </p>
            <p>
                The dehumanizing consequences of industrialization are reflected in Victor's act of creating life 
                through scientific experimentation. His unrelenting obsession with dissecting corpses and tampering
                 with nature in Chapter 4 is a prime example of how the Industrial Revolution mechanized labor. 
                 The creature is viewed as an object of Victor's ambition rather than a sentient human, much like 
                 industrial workers are reduced to gears in a machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The instant terror Victor has upon witnessing the creature serves as a critique of this mechanization,
                 highlighting the emotional and moral vacuum created by industrial advancement. According to
                  Thachduryany (2017), Shelley criticizes how industrialization eliminates humanity from the creative 
                  process and turns both workers and goods into commodities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The proletariat's revolt against the bourgeoisie can be seen as symbolized by the creature's deeds of
                 vengeance, especially the killing of William in Chapter 16. According to Marxist theory, the working
                class will rise up and overturn the capitalist system after being exploited for a long time. 
                In a similar vein, the creature's behavior results from systematic tyranny and neglect rather than
                 from inherent malice.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bourgeois fear of oppressed people standing together is emphasized by Victor's refusal to give 
                the creature a female partner. Although Victor crushes the creature's dream for company out of concern 
                that a new "race" may threaten his authority, Marxist philosophy emphasizes that solidarity among the 
                working class is necessary for revolution.

            </p>
            <p>
                The self-destructive inclinations of capitalism are symbolized by Victor's unrelenting search for the
                 monster across the Arctic. The bourgeoisie's fruitless attempts to quell the proletariat's uprising 
                 are reflected in his fixation with destroying his creation. The unviability of a society based on
                  exploitation and contempt for human needs is highlighted by Victor's final demise.

            </p>
            <p>
                In a similar vein, the creature's choice to terminate its existence at the book's end represents 
                the existential hopelessness resulting from estrangement. As a symbol of the breakdown of a capitalist
                 system that is unable to satisfy the needs of the working class, it acknowledges that its misery
                  cannot be reconciled within the current social framework (Kenton, 2024).

            </p>
            <p>
                Frankenstein's portrayal of nature contrasts sharply with the dehumanizing consequences of 
                industrialization. Victor and the creature find momentary comfort in the Alps' breathtaking grandeur, 
                which represents a world free from capitalist exploitation. This link to nature raises questions about
                 the artificiality of industrial capitalism and its propensity to rob real human experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the creature, moments of reflection in nature, as seen in Chapter 12, offer temporary reprieve
                 from its alienation. These scenes suggest that a return to natural harmony, rather than relentless 
                 industrial progress, may offer a path toward genuine connection and fulfillment.

            </p>
            <p>
                By exposing the damaging effects of class conflict, alienation, and exploitation, a Marxist 
                interpretation of Frankenstein reveals the book as a biting indictment of capitalism. While the
                 creature's revolt represents the inevitable uprising of the downtrodden, Victor Frankenstein's 
                 treatment of the creature is comparable to the bourgeoisie's exploitation of the working class.
                Mary Shelley offers a timeless cautionary tale about the repercussions of a system that puts 
                production and power ahead of people by exposing the shortcomings of industrialization and the
                dehumanizing impacts of unbridled ambition. Shelley urges a restoration to human connection and
                community responsibility by reevaluating society ideals through the interaction of creation and
                 destruction.
