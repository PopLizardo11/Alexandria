            Alexandre Dumas' "The Count of Monte Cristo"</h1>
        <h2 class="title-sub">Written by Hernan Lizardo - Dec. 17, 2024</h2>

    <section class="body-section">
        <p> “Only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss.” – These are the final words of the Count of Monte Cristo uttered by another character as they read a letter from him at the end of the story. Consequently, It is one of the few quotes that can be found in the novel that encapsulates the ideas of love, betrayal, despair and redemption that the story possesses. The combination of these ideas gave birth to the story of a young man named Edmond Dantes betrayed by the people he once considered as his friends and his carefully planned out revenge against these people. 

            </p>
            <p> The story uses different creative techniques which are not limited to the use of common character, situation and image motifs to convey its ideas through symbolisms. Additionally, being one of the older books in history as it is written in the early 19th century, it is not unlikely that it uses the same symbols that are common with the tales and myths which were known at that time. 

            </p>
            <p> 
                These motifs and patterns that can be seen in different literary pieces are called Archetypes. Heckmann (2024) highlighted that it is something that links people around the world despite the temporal and spatial differences each may have to each other. It was first introduced in the realm of psychology by Swiss Psychiatrist Carl Jung (1968) which stated it as a unifying concept that represents personification of certain behaviors that inhabits the collective unconscious of mankind as “motifs, primordial images or types.”

            </p>
            <p>
                Starting with character archetypes, Edmond Dantes, as usual for  a protagonist, represents the Hero archetype. The Hero archetype is the one that has to triumph over adversities with their courage and perseverance (Faber and Mayer, 2009). In the earlier parts of the story, Edmond Dantes is faced with the challenge of formulating and executing an escape out of the Chateau D’if, the prison in which he was locked up. His determination and persistence played an essential role in his escape of the dungeon later in the story. In addition to overcoming challenges, the Hero in the story also has to fight and succeed against the evil that exists in the story. Although his revenge on the people that betrayed him and his victory over them can be an example of this scenario, it is more appropriate to connect this characteristic of the Hero archetype of him overcoming his desire for vengeance when he spared Baron Danglars from his execution at the hands of the bandits. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Ortiz (2023) emphasized that the archetypal hero possesses extraordinary qualities like bravery, wisdom and a strong moral character. In the early part of the story about the escape out of the prison, it is noted multiple times by the narrator about Edmond’s special abilities like his seemingly unfading strength which is stated to come from his experience of being a sailor. Another one of these is his exceptional memory which helped him on his realization of the betrayal done to him and his time being educated by Abbe Faria of the things 

            </p>
            <p>
                Besides the archetype Hero, Edmond Dantes also represents the Scapegoat archetype. Adji (2020) stated that this archetype is the manifestation for things or  individuals that are blamed for the sins of society and in result became the one that is sacrificed for it. The false accusations that resulted in his conviction in prison stems from the political battle and war that is currently happening considering the story takes place at the time of the Napoleonic Era. The combination of the false accusations on him fabricated by his enemies and corruption of the acting public prosecutor at that moment made it so that he is the one to suffer the punishment of the things that he has no involvement in. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Abbe Faria represents the Mentor archetype in the story. Characters with this archetype serve as protagonist’ guide, advisor and teacher. He possesses the knowledge, skills and abilities that the protagonist lacks and helps the protagonist develop their abilities and overcome obstacles along his journey (Feccomandi, 2023). The character of Abbe Faria is introduced at the later part of the prison segment of the story  as the protagonist’ sole companion in the dungeon. Initially at his meeting with Edmond, he is shown to have different tools in his cell such as paper and pen showing his craftsmanship and resourcefulness that even though Edmond has, it still falls short in terms of skill level. He is also portrayed as well-educated and intelligent as he is able to deduce the reason for the protagonist’ conviction just from the information told to him by Edmond. Through his teachings alone, Edmond Dantes is able to be and act like an educated man. The education that he provided for Edmond unlocked the hidden potential of the young man in terms of critical thinking and planning. His last great act for Edmond by giving him the instructions for the treasure hidden in Monte Cristo paved the way for Edmond Dantes’ enactment of his revenge against his enemies. 

            </p>
            <p>
                The Villain archetype is represented by the character of Baron Danglars. The Villain is the character that opposes the hero in the story. Despite being that many are involved in the imprisonment of the Edmond Dantes like with the case of Caderousse, Fernand and Villefort, Danglars is the one that initiated the plan of the Edmond’s downfall due to being envious of the young man’s promotion in being the new captain of their ship. Lummer (2023) noted the strengths of this archetype lies in their cunning, resourceful, persistent and charismatic nature. Danglar’s clever use of the young man’s trip in the Isle of Elba as a source of false accusation and the concealment of handwriting by writing some of the part of the message with his left hand exemplified the cunning and resourceful nature of the Villain that Danglars possess. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Lummer also noted the weaknesses of the Villain archetype which is over-ambitiousness, lack of empathy and tendency to be blinded by their goals. At the latter part of the story, Edmond Dantes in the persona of the Count of Monte Cristo exploited this archetypal weakness of Danglars which is his love for money. The Count successfully tempted Danglars in opening up an unlimited credit between their firms which made it possible for the count to have control over Danglars money and make him lose a huge chunk of his fortune in his account. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Another archetype found in the novel is the Star-Crossed Lovers represented by Edmond Dantes and Mercedes. This archetype is that of a perfectly-matched couple who are deeply in love with each other but cannot be together by circumstances outside of their control (https://knowyourarchetypes.com, n.d). In the beginning of the story, the marriage between Edmond and Mercedes is interrupted by an arrest which resulted in the long imprisonment of the groom. This circumstance made it impossible for them to be together and when they have met each other again, Mercedes is already with Fernand due to her giving up believing that his lover will ever get out or still alive. In spite of all that, Mercedes still admires Edmond Dantes as seen by her dialogue when she is seen begging for the duel between the Count and his son to be stopped. 
“Forgive, Edmond, forgive for the sake of Mercedes, who still loves you!”

            </p>
            <p>
                Besides the character archetypes, Situational archetypes can also be observed in the story of The Count of Monte Cristo. This type of archetype refers to the situations or series of events that happens usually in stories. A minor detail may change but the essence of what it is trying to do in the story remains intact. 

            </p>
            <p>
                The situational archetype of the Death and Rebirth can be found in the story of The Count of Monte Cristo. According to Safford (n.d), this situational archetype suggests the Hero’s journey as a cycle of life in which even though all things die, it is somehow reborn. This archetype is an essential part of the story as it is part of the core message of the novel about experiencing death first to know what life really is. A great example of this archetype is the experience of Edmond Dantes he had in Chateau D’if which signifies death and his rebirth when he escaped from it with the experience and potential fortune he got from Faria. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Another situational archetype is the initiation which is represented from the realization of Edmond Dantes as to who made the false accusation against him. Safford stated that the Initiation archetype is the mark in the story when the hero is introduced to a new world full of uncertainty and danger. In the case of Edmond Dantes, his realization introduced him not to a literal new world but an innate world fueled by emotions of anger and vengeance to those who wronged him. This is the moment in the story where the persona of the Count of Monte Cristo starts to show as his desire for vengeance is seen by his cold rational and ambitious-driven decisions. Abbe Faria even stated that he regret making Edmond realize the truth of the situation because of how he put something that there was never before inside Edmond which is the desire for revenge. 
	“Because I’ve instilled in your heart a feeling that wasn’t there before: vengeance” 

            </p>
            <p>
                The Count of Monte Cristo also makes use of symbolic archetypes. An example of a symbolic archetype is the Sea surrounding the Chateau D’if. Robertson et. al. (2019) stated that the sea symbolizes paradoxes as it can bring hope and life but can also create fear and destruction, a realm of potential but can also mean limitations and restrictions. This symbolism aligns with the story as even though Edmond Dantes is inside a dungeon isolated from the outside world which means that there are restrictions put upon him but it did not stop from showing growth in his stay in it. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Another symbolic archetype is that of a garden. Garden symbolizes those of innocence, peace and happiness (umich.edu, n.d). There are two gardens in the story shown, the Garden of the Morrel’s and the Garden of Villefort’s. The Garden of the Morrel’s is filled with flowers and is lively, symbolizing that the idea of innocence, peace and happiness are still present within the people that own it. On the other hand, the Villefort’s garden from their old house is unmaintained and bleak which represents the loss of peace and happiness there once was and lack of innocence due to an incident that happened within that house.
