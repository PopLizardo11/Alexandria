        <p> “From the society of the twentieth century, it is indeed that the birth of
            rejuvenation elixir is marred by the implacable count of time.” Acquiring timeless youth
            is one of the mythical fragments that human inventiveness has ever captured. This
            exhorted anyone who sought possibilities from impossibilities to unearthed the secret of
            eternal youth through empirical science. Subsequently, it may be rooted to untimely
            incidence of love and the disappreciation of aging as time goes by. Technically, it is quite
            implausible to draw evidence of how these events may serve into the realm of facts.
            Consequently, it embarked on numerous approaches and experimentations that are
            susceptible to improperness. These parameters projected how far the length of humans
            will go to achieve their anomalous desires. This emergence put spotlight on Arthur
            Conan Doyle’s passion for literature and how he meticulously wrote his fourteen-page
            portion of The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes.
            </p>
            <p> The Adventure of the Creeping Man is one of Sherlock Holmes short stories
                entwined with some sort of science fiction and horror elements published by a British
                author named Arthur Conan Doyle. It first appeared in print media in The Strand
                magazine and later on published in 1927 as part of the anthology of The Casebook of
                Sherlock Holmes. The story revolves in the quest of Sherlock Holmes to solve the
                mystery of Jack Bennett’s future father-in-law named Professor Presbury. Accusingly,
                the indicted professor has been exhibiting furtive and sly behaviors. The story
                culminates in a confrontation where Professor Presbury becomes violent and Holmes
                and Watson’s operative respond to prevent this smoldering harm. In the latter part, they
                found out that the professor is injecting a serum from a black-faced langur monkey to
                acquire its characteristics of walking erect. Relatively, Professor Presbury is a
                61-year-old physiologist and has become engaged to younger Alice Morphy, which led
                him to ingest the drug to take back his youth.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Biographically, it was the year of 1859 where Arthur Conan Doyle was born in
                Edinburgh, Scotland. During his formative years, he read medicinal references at
                Edinburgh University in 1896 and obtained his doctorate in 1885 by proposing a
                research of the condition caused by the disease syphilis (degeneration of sensory
                neurons that makes the body malfunction). Furthermore, he also served his medical
                profession on ship during numerous voyages around the coast of West Africa. This
                background with regard to the author heaved his penchant to medicinal science fiction,
                underpinning his literature that emerged and existed in the 20th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, Edinburgh University is the place where he became acquainted with
                his mentor named Dr. Joseph Bell and another lecturer Sir Patrick Watson who became
                the inspiration for the character of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson respectively.
                Consequently, these individuals demonstrate great skills of observation, surgery skills,
                and objective deduction (Hoekstra, 2015). This is evident in the attributes that Doyle
                implanted to Sherlock Holmes’ character to become the well-known detective in the
                realm of literature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Relatively, The Adventure of the Creeping Man correlates to the experiences and
                works of Arthur Conan Doyle that encapsulates the thrill of medicine for anti-aging.
                During the two decades that preceded the setting of the story in 1903, rejuvenation
                through what came to be called “organotherapy” was a subject of heated controversy
                across the medical profession and general public (Hektoen International, 2024).
                Historically, the author’s intention in the central theme of the Adventure of the Creeping
                Man was inclined in the interesting real event that happened in 1889. Consequently, the
                identity of Charles-Edouard Brown-Sequard was subjected to the tabooed practice of
                rejuvenation. A report stated that he had injected himself with a subcutaneous fluid from
                the testicles of guinea pigs and dogs. Shortly after, he reported that it helped him to be
                able to do what he can during his youthful years such as sexual activity and virility.
                Eventually, this reached much controversy during the late 19th century as it resulted in
                perilous illness. In a series of experiments on guinea pigs extending from 1869 to 1891,
                Brown-Séquard observed that a partial severing of the spinal cord, or a complete
                severing of the sciatic nerve, was followed after a few weeks by morbid state
                resembling epilepsy in the height of his testicular injection (Snell, n.d.).
            </p>
            <p>
                These real scenarios are being reflected in the scene of Professor Presbury
                where he experienced strange attributes after he had injected langur serum. The events
                before the creation of Adventure of The Creeping Man beam lights to the concern of
                Arthur Conan Doyle in the existing medical dilemma in the society. The rise of the
                charlatans succumbed to public pressure and acclaim during that time is the reason
                why Doyle disclosed Lowenstein of Prague as the subject to the practice of illegal
                quackery. Correspondingly, this work of Conan Doyle has the similar grounds of genre
                and theme to the book “The Gland Illusion" by John Nanninga that unveiled the
                attempts of rejuvenation through organotherapy. Generally, the early writings of Doyle
                encompasses British history and the accelerating issue toward endocrine medicines.
                Despite these popularity, Conan Doyle never suspected that these stories would be the
                foundation of his literary legacy to the mystery and science genre.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conclusively, it is indeed that behind the pages, there are countless roots of
                influences that led the author to penned a literary composition. Arthur Conan Doyle
                exemplified this practice as resulted in his well-known series book of Sherlock Holmes
                across the corners of writing. In a figurative sense, just like Sherlock Holmes, the
                biographical approach enabled us to observe and identify not only the technical and
                formalities of this work, but also the reason behind its theme and occurrences. The
                Adventure of the Creeping Man is deemed the blueprint of Doyle’s experiences and
                motive during 20th century incidences of medicinal concerns. This work might be
                fictitious but it resembles specific events in the history that traversed in the pens and ink
                of Arthur Conan Doyle
