        <p> 
            Holly Jackson's A Good Girl's Guide to Murder is an intriguing book whereby readers can join Pippa Fitz-Amobi, a high school student, as she uncovers a mystery and every time she uncovers things, the truth becomes un-clear, but everybody, it seems, believes it one way - criminal at the scene of the crime, but Pippa is determined to know just what happened. This novel is steeped in heavy topics such as justice, prejudice, and morality, making one reflect on how assumptions, biases, and secrets affect how we look for the truth and form opinions about people. It also forces readers to think about the issues in ways they might not have considered before. Pippa is working on the case surrounding the supposed murder of Andie Bell and Salil Singh's suicide; the more she digs into it, the more everything she thought she knew starts to unravel.

        </p>
        <p> The deeper she gets into the investigation, the more questions arise, and what everyone believed about Sal and Andie’s deaths is slowly turned upside down. A key aspect that makes the story compelling is how the book gives insight into Pippa’s thoughts and feelings, making you feel like you are right there with her, questioning everything and trying to figure out who could be guilty and who might be innocent. Each discovery she makes leads to new revelations that cause the readers to rethink who is involved, and with every clue, the mystery becomes more intriguing.

        </p>
        <p>
            From the start, Pippa does not accept the story, more of a gossip that circulates the town, and has been telling for years about Salil Singh killing Andie and then taking his own life, and as she digs into the case, the more she realizes that there is not enough evidence to support this version of events. She begins to wonder if the town is unfairly judging Sal because of his background as well as his citizenship rather than the facts, and knowing Sal, she refuses to accept the town’s assumptions without questioning them. Instead, she decides to investigate on her own as she is determined to know what is the truth behind the crime no matter what everyone else believes.

        </p>
        <p>
            Pippa’s investigation started with Ravi, brother of Sal, and gathered information from him on whoever is suspicious from the circle of Sal. He told her that Sal’s best friend might be in love with his brother and this leads to her thinking that the crime committed by ‘her’ could be from the range of jealousy. This leads her to Naomi Ward, Sal’s best friend, and while Naomi initially seems innocent and supportive, as Pippa asks more questions, Naomi becomes defensive. There’s a particular moment when Naomi says, “Sal was my best friend; I loved him like a brother. But Andie… she wasn’t good for him,” and this statement makes Pippa start wondering if Naomi might have more to hide than she lets on. Later, when Pippa presses Naomi with more questions, Naomi responds, “I already told the police everything five years ago,” which makes Pippa suspect that Naomi is trying to avoid talking about the past. Naomi’s defensive reactions make her appear more suspicious, and Pippa begins to wonder if Naomi had a motive for harming Andie.

        </p>
        <p>
            As Pippa continues her investigation, she later on sees what the father of Andie Bell has posted. Instead of using present tense, he had used past tense “was” that concludes that they might know what really had happened to their daughter, Andie. She talks to Jason Bell, Andie’s father, and his responses to Pippa’s questions are not only angry but also very defensive. He seems to be trying to protect something or someone, which makes Pippa think that he might know more than he’s willing to admit. When Pippa confronts him, Jason says, “You don’t know what you’re talking about. My family has been through enough because of Andie,” and his harsh tone makes Pippa even more suspicious because it seems like he’s hiding something. The complicated relationship between Jason and Andie further makes Pippa believe that Jason might have had a reason to hurt her.

        </p>
        <p>
            Pippa then learns about an older man who Andie might have been involved with, and at first, Pippa does not know much about this person, but as she learns more, it becomes clear that Andie might have had a relationship outside of her close circle of friends. This revelation only adds more mystery to the case because it suggests that Andie’s life had hidden aspects no one knew about, and those secrets could hold the key to understanding what happened to her. Each new piece of information deepens the mystery and makes Pippa more determined to eventually reveal the hidden truth and get to the bottom of it.

        </p>
        <p>
            Next, Pippa looks into Nat da Silva, Sal’s younger brother, who doesn’t speak much but clearly knows something that he isn’t sharing. Pippa notices that when she talks to him, he seems to be holding something back, and this makes her think that Nat might be hiding important details. His silence and his reactions when talking about Sal and Andie make him appear suspicious, and it seems like he might know more than he is letting on.

        </p>
        <p>
            Pippa also questions Daniel da Silva, a local police officer, who warns her to stop looking deeper into the case. He says, “Let it go. You’re digging into things that don’t concern you,” and his attempt to stop her makes her think that Daniel could be trying to protect someone or hide the truth. His behavior raises more suspicions, and Pippa starts to think that he might be involved in keeping secrets about the case. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Max Hastings, Andie’s former friend, becomes another person on Pippa’s list of suspects. Max had a possessive and controlling relationship with Andie, and when Pippa finds a message Andie wrote to a friend that says, “Max thinks he owns everyone. He doesn’t. He can’t control me,” it makes Pippa wonder if there was more to their relationship than anyone realized. Max’s attitude when Pippa questions him about Andie’s death only makes things worse because he acts as though he doesn’t care at all, which makes Pippa more certain that he could be hiding something important. Apart from this, it was eventually known that he is also a drug dealer of Andie.

        </p>
        <p>
            Pippa also investigates Howie Bowers, another person who was connected to Andie. At first, Howie does not seem that important to the case, but the more Pippa finds out, the more she begins to think that Howie might know more but is keeping himself silent. The fact that he knows Andie would make him a person of interest, Pippa began to pay more attention unto him.

        </p>
        <p>
            In order to keep track of everything, Pippa creates a spider diagram to connect all the people she’s investigating, and this helps her organize her thoughts and focus on the main suspects. By looking at the relationships between people: Howie, Jason, Daniel, Nat, and Max, Pippa is able to narrow down who might be involved in the case. The more she looks into these people, the more it becomes clear that they all have something to hide which  leads Pippa to get closer to figuring out who is the culprit.

        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, Pippa uncovers the truth about Andie’s death, and it turns out that Becca Bell, Andie’s best friend, is the one who actually caused Andie’s death. Becca and Andie had a violent argument, and during the fight, Andie accidentally died. Becca, scared and unsure of what to do, hid Andie’s body and made it look like she had disappeared. Becca’s brother, Elliot, then went even further to cover up the truth by framing Sal for Andie’s death, making it look like Sal had killed himself out of guilt.

        </p>
        <p>
            For five years, everyone believed that Sal had killed Andie, but in reality, he was innocent. Through Pippa’s investigation, all the lies and secrets were exposed, and the whole town had been wrong about what happened. The truth of this crime was much darker and surprising knowing that these people are the ones whom Pippa and Andie trusted. This was reflected from all of the lies that they have committed in order to avoid staining their reputation.

        </p>
        <p>
            A Good Girl's Guide to Murder  is considered both a mystery and a social commentary. This book illustrates the flawed justice system that we have, an unreliable witness, as well as insusceptible suspects. Holly Jackson invites readers to question the stories they are told and prejudices they unknowingly carry. The novel’s complex web of suspects ensures that readers remain as invested in the case as Pip, delivering the theme that truth is often buried beneath layers of assumption and bias.
