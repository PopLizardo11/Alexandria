    <section class="body-section">
        <p> Fiveable (n.d) defined that character archetypes resonate with our human “collective unconscious” 
            because they portray recurring themes, motifs, or symbols found in literature from different cultures
             and periods. 
            </p>
            <p> Unlike other books that have one hero, “Are You Afraid of the Dark?” has two: Kelly Harris and Diane Stevens. After their partners’ deaths, Tanner Kingsley, the one behind the killings, went after the two women to make sure that no one would know his secret. Kelly and Diane journey together hand-in-hand and face multiple dangers to uncover the truth of their partner’s death. They exemplify the common characteristics of a hero, such as bravery, resilience, courage, determination, and more (First Daft Pro, n.d). 

            </p>
            <p>
                Another character archetype in the story is Tanner Kingsley, the villain. He opposes Kelly and Diane's goal to learn the real meaning of their partners’ deaths. He secretly tricked Kelly and Diane into thinking that he was sympathetic to their partners’ deaths. This gave him leverage so that he could easily assassinate the two women. According to Grahl (2023), a villain opposes the protagonist’s goals and desires. Some of its characteristics are intelligent and ideologically driven, which Tanner has. He has negative traits such as greed and over-ambitiousness that embody the typical villain archetypal character. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Callaghan (2023) stated that the mentor figure serves as a guide or a teacher to the protagonist. This archetype is not outwardly expressed in the story, but the memories of Kelly and Diane’s husband guided and motivated them to continue pursuing the truth. Their husband’s unfinished work indirectly gave them clues and led them in the right direction. 

            </p>
            <p>
                In stories, the protagonist always has someone at their side. These are allies who back up and help the protagonist (Grahl, 2023). In this book, Kelly and Diane are considered each other’s “ally” or “helper.” They support and become each other’s emotional anchor, helping them get through life-threatening situations. Another helper archetype is Kelly and Diane’s husbands. They didn’t only serve as a mentor, but also a help to both women. The pieces of evidence gathered while they were still alive assisted Kelly and Diane in not only uncovering their deaths but also exposing Tanner’s crimes. Detective Earl Greenburg and Harry Flint are also considered Kelly and Diane’s “helpers.” Greenburg’s professional role as a detective unintentionally motivates the two protagonists to go after the truth instead of accepting their partner’s death. On the other hand, Harry Flint is an antagonist hired by Tanner to assassinate the protagonists. His multiple attempts to kill gave Kelly and Diane a chance to adjust instantly, helping them live longer and stay resilient. 

            </p>
            <p>
                The innocent archetype shows simplicity and belief in the goodness of people of a character. They are naive which can lead them into dangerous situations (Dinsdale,2024). Just like at the start of the novel, Kelly and Diane are innocent of what the world is like. Both led normal lives; Kelly is a supermodel while Diane is an artist. Their trust and love for their husbands made them unaware of the dark secrets the company of their husbands worked for holds. Their husbands were a blanket that protected them from the world. Now gone, they were confronted by the harsh realities and lost their sense of security. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from character archetypes, Are You Afraid of the Dark also exemplifies situational archetypes. IPL (2023) explained that a character undergoes the “Loss of Innocence” when it is impacted by the tragedies or events that happened at a young age, forcing it to grow from a child into an adult. Kelly Harris lost her innocence when she was a child. She was a lovechild of a well-off father and her mother was a maid of her father’s family. The family disagreed because of their differences, leading to her father abandoning them. Later on, her mother met someone and lived with him. While her mother was away, his stepfather sexually abused Kelly. He was also ill-mannered to Kelly and oftentimes joked that she should become a stripper because of her beautiful body and face. This left trauma to her and made her wary of men. This is evident when she does not accept her husband’s advances. Mark (her husband) continued and fought for her love.

            </p>
            <p>
                In the quest archetype, the protagonist must reach a certain location, attain a certain object, or fulfill a specific objective while overcoming many obstacles along the way (MasterClass, 2021). The protagonist’s quest is to embark on a journey to uncover the truth about their husbands’ deaths and expose the corruption inside KIG. This involves solving puzzles, avoiding dangers, escaping from assassinations, gathering evidence of Tanner’s wrongdoing, overcoming their traumas, and working together to throw off the villain. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Tanner Kingsley consumed by his insatiable desire for greed and power represents the fall archetype. Anthony (2024) stated that it is the descent of a character from a higher to a lower state due to the absence of morals or ethics. Tanner’s fall started once he sabotaged his brother’s experiment leading to declination of his health. He was made the head of KIG and from then on, the company made for philanthropy turned into a façade only, and behind was Tanner’s corruption and greed for power. 

            </p>
            <p>
                The battle between good and evil is a situational archetype that shows the struggle between opposing forces (Anthony, 2024). The archetype is seen between Kelly and Diane versus Tanner Kingsley. Kelly and Diane represented the good side. Despite their tragedies, they still strive to seek justice for their husbands. Their actions are driven by their love for their partners and their uprightness. In the latter part, Tanner Kingsley is the representation of evil. He is willing to sacrifice lives, even his brother, to achieve his goals of global domination and profit through it. He is also good at manipulating and cunning people by sweet-talking and deceiving them into thinking they share the same goals. Kelly and Diane won by outsmarting Tanner’s hitmen, discovering Prima- the weather-control technology Tanner wants to use for profit, and publicly exposing him by leaking KIG’s illegal activities to the media. In the end, the good prevails. It asserts that despite underestimating and downplaying the good side, it can overcome evil through perseverance, resiliency, and courage
